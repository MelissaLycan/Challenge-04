# Challenge-04
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score


This challenge began with writing basic html code.

I created an object for each question and an array for choices

by far the most challenging part of this assignment was getting the questions to line up using the radio buttons that I created.  However now that I understand the Boolean values in Radio buttons I beieve I can do this again with little effort.  In addition I had to create functions that compared each of the choices with the correct answer.  I went back and forth with numbers verses string inputs but settled on string.
